# This repository contains five parts as follows: 

### 1.[Data Folder](https://github.com/zijinw9527/STAT628_ModuleTwo20/tree/master/data)

You can explore the raw data and our cleaned data in this folder.


### 2.[Code Folder](https://github.com/zijinw9527/STAT628_ModuleTwo20/tree/master/code)

All the code for data preprocessing, model selection and model validation are included.


### 3. [Image Folder](https://github.com/zijinw9527/STAT628_ModuleTwo20/tree/master/image)

All the figures/images/tables produced by our code are shown here.


### 4. [Summary File](https://github.com/zijinw9527/STAT628_ModuleTwo20/blob/master/Summary.pdf)

A two-page file summarizing every effort we make to build up the model. What's more, we give detailed interpretation on how we select the "best" model illustrating the relationship between body fat and some easily measurable factors.


### 5. [README File](https://github.com/zijinw9527/STAT628_ModuleTwo20/tree/master/README.md)

You can always refer to this README file to find the contents of the repository and directions on how to use the code.


# To use the code

Run **git clone https://github.com/zijinw9527/STAT628_ModuleTwo20** in the terminal to clone this repository in the terminal or just click the green "Clone or download" button on the upper right corner to download all the contents as a zipped folder. Unzip the folder, then you can explore the data and excute our R code on your own (keep in mind to always change the working directory to the folder before running the code) to see how we build up our model. The plots in the image folder and the summary file are recommanded for further understanding the details of this project.
